His deconstruction of the classic monster stretched the creative boundaries of the medium and became one of the most spectacular series in comic book history. With modern-day issues explored against a backdrop of horror, SWAMP THING's stories became commentaries on environmental, political and social issues, unflinching in their relevance. SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING BOOK ONE collects issues #20-27 of this seminal series including the never-before-reprinted SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING #20, where Moore takes over as writer and concludes the previous storyline. Book One begins with the story \"The Anatomy Lesson,\" a haunting origin story that reshapes SWAMP THING mythology with terrifying revelations that begin a journey of discovery and adventure that will take him across the stars and beyond.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781401241186"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1401241182"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Comics & Graphic Novels"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":51,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"2.3.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":true,"containsImageBubbles":true,"epubBubbleVersion":"3d9fa2a32c7c50f3","imageBubbleVersion":"3d9fa2a32c7c50f3"},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Saga+of+the+Swamp+Thing&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ","seriesInfo":{"kind":"books#volume_series_info","bookDisplayNumber":"1","volumeSeries":[{"seriesId":"MIjXFwAAABDmnM","seriesBookType":"COLLECTED_EDITION","orderNumber":1,"issue":[{"issueOrderNumber":20,"issueDisplayNumber":"20"},{"issueOrderNumber":21,"issueDisplayNumber":"21"},{"issueOrderNumber":22,"issueDisplayNumber":"22"},{"issueOrderNumber":23,"issueDisplayNumber":"23"},{"issueOrderNumber":24,"issueDisplayNumber":"24"},{"issueOrderNumber":25,"issueDisplayNumber":"25"},{"issueOrderNumber":26,"issueDisplayNumber":"26"},{"issueOrderNumber":27,"issueDisplayNumber":"27"}]}]}},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":5.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":5.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zVnsAQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":5990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":5990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Saga_of_the_Swamp_Thing_Book_One-sample-epub.acsm?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Saga_of_the_Swamp_Thing_Book_One-sample-pdf.acsm?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zVnsAQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING BOOK ONE collects issues #20-27 of this seminal series including the never-before-reprinted SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING #20, where Moore takes over as writer and concludes the previous storyline."}}
