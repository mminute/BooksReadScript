Isaac Asimov was the Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America, the founder of robot ethics, and one of the world's most prolific authors of fiction and non-fiction. The Good Doctor's short fiction has been enjoyed by millions for more than half a century. Now the definitive Asimov collection is underway with Volume One of The Complete Stories. Many of these stories are classics of the genre, and the last, 'The Last Question', the absolute personal favourite of Asimov himself. Always entertaining and thought provoking, these stories display Asimov's mastery of the short story form. He remains supreme as the thinking person's science fiction writer.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780006476474"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0006476473"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":429,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["American fiction"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BVnaF63RVs0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BVnaF63RVs0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BVnaF63RVs0C&dq=Isaac+Asimov:+The+Complete+Stories-+Vol+1&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BVnaF63RVs0C&dq=Isaac+Asimov:+The+Complete+Stories-+Vol+1&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Complete_Stories.html?hl=&id=BVnaF63RVs0C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BVnaF63RVs0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Now the definitive Asimov collection is underway with Volume One of The Complete Stories.
