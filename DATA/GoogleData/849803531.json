Cain"],"publisher":"Vintage Crime/Black Lizard","publishedDate":"2010-12-29","description":"In Mildred Pierce, noir master James M. Cain creates a novel of acute social observation and devasting emotional violence, with a heroine whose ambitions and sufferings are never less than recognizable. Mildred Pierce had gorgeous legs, a way with a skillet, and a bone-deep core of toughness. She used those attributes to survive a divorce and poverty and to claw her way out of the lower middle class. But Mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307772930"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307772934"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":304,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":27,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.7.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mildred+Pierce&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":8.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":8.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&rdid=book-6G-BF2GTGdAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":8990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":8990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Mildred_Pierce-sample-epub.acsm?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6G-BF2GTGdAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In Mildred Pierce, noir master James M.
