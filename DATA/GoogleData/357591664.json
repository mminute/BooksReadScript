Time for a cup of tea! Join the cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his uncommon comrades in arms in their desperate search for a place to eat, as they hurtle across space powered by pure improbability. Among Arthur’s motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a longtime friend and expert contributor to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMillan, a fellow Earth refugee who’s gone native (her name is Trillian now); and Marvin, the moody android. Their destination? The ultimate hot spot for an evening of apocalyptic entertainment and fine dining, where the food speaks for itself (literally). “What’s such fun is how amusing the galaxy looks through Adams’s sardonically silly eyes.”—Detroit Free Press","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307497569"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307497567"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":2912,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.13.9.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Restaurant+at+the+End+of+the+Universe&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&rdid=book-DQ-wif7eBJoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Univers-sample-epub.acsm?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Univers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DQ-wif7eBJoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Among Arthur’s motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a longtime friend and expert contributor to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMillan, a fellow ..."}}
