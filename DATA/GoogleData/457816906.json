Hailed as one of the best books of 2015 by NPR. Wily, charming Kuni Garu, a bandit, and stern, fearless Mata Zyndu, the son of a deposed duke, seem like polar opposites. Yet, in the uprising against the emperor, the two quickly become the best of friends after a series of adventures fighting against vast conscripted armies, silk-draped airships, and shapeshifting gods. Once the emperor has been overthrown, however, they each find themselves the leader of separate factions—two sides with very different ideas about how the world should be run and the meaning of justice. Fans of intrigue, intimate plots, and action will find a new series to embrace in the Dandelion Dynasty.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781481424295"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1481424297"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":640,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":19,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.20.16.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Grace+of+Kings&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-y4veAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=y4veAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Two men rebel together against tyranny—and then become rivals—in this first sweeping book of an epic fantasy series from Ken Liu, recipient of Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards.
