From a troubled childhood in industrial Essex, England, to his descent into addictions to alcohol, drugs, and sex in the seamy underbelly of London, Brand has seen his share of both and miraculously lived to tell the tale. In My Booky Wook he leads readers on a rollicking journey through his disastrous school career, his infamous antics on MTV, and his multifarious sexual adventures. But this irreverent memoir is a story not simply of struggle but also of redemption, a testament to the difficulty of discovering what you want from life and the remarkable power of a bloody-minded determination to get it. My Booky Wook is a giddy trip through the brilliant mind of one of Britain's most valuable exports.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780061857805"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0061857807"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":368,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":5,"maturityRating":"MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rc67KVgEcUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rc67KVgEcUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rc67KVgEcUgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=My+Booky+Wook&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rc67KVgEcUgC&dq=My+Booky+Wook&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/My_Booky_Wook.html?hl=&id=rc67KVgEcUgC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/My_Booky_Wook-sample-epub.acsm?id=rc67KVgEcUgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rc67KVgEcUgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"From a troubled childhood in industrial Essex, England, to his descent into addictions to alcohol, drugs, and sex in the seamy underbelly of London, Brand has seen his share of both and miraculously lived to tell the tale."}}
