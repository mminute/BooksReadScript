When a passenger plane crashes in Newfoundland under unexplained circumstances, Honey is determined to prove his unorthodox theory about what went wrong to his superiors, before more lives are lost. But while flying to the crash scene to investigate, Honey discovers to his horror that he is on board one of the defective planes and that he and his fellow passengers, including a friendly young stewardess and an aging movie actress, are in imminent peril.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307474124"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307474127"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":300,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":5,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&pg=PT250&dq=No+Highway&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=keZJdWpk7K4C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&rdid=book-keZJdWpk7K4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/No_Highway-sample-epub.acsm?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/No_Highway-sample-pdf.acsm?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=keZJdWpk7K4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"“<b>No</b>, I mean the actual buildings to house the experimental work.” “That&#39;s right. <br>\nLike the stages that we put up the sets in, ready to start shooting the scene.” I <br>\nthought of the great barnlike buildings I had read about, “Yes—just like that,” I <br>\nsaid."}}
