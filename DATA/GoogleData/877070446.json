Discover secrets buried by years of devastating war, in which magic-fueled weapons threatened an entire continent. In the post-war world, magic pervades everyday life, and people of all sorts flock to Sharn, a city of wonders where skyscrapers pierce the clouds. Will you find your fortune on mean city streets or scouring the secrets of haunted battlefields? Will you throw in your lot with the mighty dragonmarked houses, ruthless families who control whole nations? Will you seek truth as a newspaper reporter, a university researcher, or a government spy? Or will you forge a destiny that defies the scars of war? This book provides tools that both players and Dungeon Masters need to explore the world of Eberron, including the artificer character class—a master of magical invention—and monsters birthed by ancient warmongering forces. Will Eberron enter a prosperous new age or will the shadow of war descend once again?","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0786966890"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780786966899"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":320,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Games & Activities"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GqzUyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GqzUyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GqzUyAEACAAJ&dq=Dungeons+and+Dragons:+Eberron,+Rising+From+the+Last+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GqzUyAEACAAJ&dq=Dungeons+and+Dragons:+Eberron,+Rising+From+the+Last+War&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Eberron_Rising_from_the_Last_War_D_d_Cam.html?hl=&id=GqzUyAEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GqzUyAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Discover secrets buried by years of devastating war, in which magic-fueled weapons threatened an entire continent."}}
