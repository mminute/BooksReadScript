Tourists of the world unite! If you've ever craved a guided tour of Fabletown's secret Manhattan location, prepare to be voraciously satiated. Pinnochio has a field day taking a certain VIP around the city. And exactly which Fabletown denizens are no longer active (dead, alive or otherwise) just might shock you into a comic-book coma. Also in this volume, you'll find the 4-part story featuring Freddy and Mouse, two local rogues who just want to get along and perhaps turn a bit of profit in the post-war, topsy-turvy world. Meanwhile, in Fabletown, a new political group forms called the Society of Seconds, and what they want doesn't seem very reasonable at all. Collects issues #76-82 in Bill Willingham-s Eisner Award-winning Vertigo series.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781401236151"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1401236154"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Comics & Graphic Novels"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.3.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":true,"containsImageBubbles":true,"epubBubbleVersion":"7adef2da4d4d3b3a","imageBubbleVersion":"7adef2da4d4d3b3a"},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fables:+The+Dark+Ages&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ","seriesInfo":{"kind":"books#volume_series_info","shortSeriesBookTitle":"The Dark Ages","bookDisplayNumber":"12","volumeSeries":[{"seriesId":"JflXGQAAABBz4M","seriesBookType":"COLLECTED_EDITION","orderNumber":12,"issue":[{"issueOrderNumber":76,"issueDisplayNumber":"76"},{"issueOrderNumber":77,"issueDisplayNumber":"77"},{"issueOrderNumber":78,"issueDisplayNumber":"78"},{"issueOrderNumber":79,"issueDisplayNumber":"79"},{"issueOrderNumber":80,"issueDisplayNumber":"80"},{"issueOrderNumber":81,"issueDisplayNumber":"81"},{"issueOrderNumber":82,"issueDisplayNumber":"82"}]},{"seriesId":"4BQqGwAAABDLDM","seriesBookType":"COLLECTED_EDITION","orderNumber":12,"issue":[{"issueDisplayNumber":"76"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"77"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"78"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"79"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"80"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"81"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"82"}]}]}},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":17.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-pSvfAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":17990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Fables_Vol_12_The_Dark_Ages-sample-epub.acsm?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Fables_Vol_12_The_Dark_Ages-sample-pdf.acsm?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pSvfAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Also in this volume, you&#39;ll find the 4-part story featuring Freddy and Mouse, two local rogues who just want to get along and perhaps turn a bit of profit in the post-war, topsy-turvy world."}}
