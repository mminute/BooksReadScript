It is, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri demonstrate in this bold work, the new political order of globalization. Their book shows how this emerging Empire is fundamentally different from the imperialism of European dominance and capitalist expansion in previous eras. Rather, today's Empire draws on elements of U.S. constitutionalism, with its tradition of hybrid identities and expanding frontiers. More than analysis, Empire is also an unabashedly utopian work of political philosophy.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0674038320"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780674038325"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":496,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Philosophy"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":11,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.2.2.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Empire&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC&dq=Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Empire.html?hl=&id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Empire-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_Hrwu8KSmBIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Imperialism as we knew it may be no more, but Empire is alive and well.
