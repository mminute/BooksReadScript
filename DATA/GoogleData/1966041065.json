I lift my head and I spread my arms. This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest. I wished to know the meaning of all things. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being. I need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the warrant and the sanction. Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a sacrifice on their alters.” ― Ayn Rand, Anthem Ayn Randy’s dystopian novel imagines a world where the concept of self has been erased. When one man stands against the establishment, he dares to utter the word “I.” This Xist Classics edition has been professionally formatted for e-readers with a linked table of contents.
