Flip over for fantasies in fetish with dramatic costumes and the allure of submission. Burlesque and the Art of the Teese \"I advocate glamour. Every day. Every minute.\" I'm a good dancer and a nice girl, but I'm a great showgirl. I sell, in a word, magic. Burlesque is a world of illusion and dreams and of course, the striptease. Whether I am bathing in my martini glass, riding my sparkling carousel horse, or emerging from my giant gold powder compact, I live out my most glamorous fantasies by bringing nostalgic imagery to life. Let me show you my world of gorgeous pin-ups, tantalizing stripteases, and femmes fatales. I'll give you a glimpse into my life, but a lady never reveals all. Fetish and the Art of the Teese You may have come for the fetish. Or you may just be sneaking a peek at this mysterious and peculiar other side. No matter what you've come for, there is something for you to indulge in. My world of fetish may not be the one that you would expect. As a burlesque performer, I entice my audience, bringing their minds closer and closer to sex and then -- as good temptress must -- snatching it away. As a fetish star, I apply the same techniques. . . . An opera-length kid leather glove, a strict wasp waist, an impossibly high patent leather heel, a severely painted red lip. . . . Come with me into my world of decadent fetishism.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0060591676"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780060591670"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":272,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Art"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":5,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RalKAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RalKAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RalKAQAACAAJ&dq=Burlesque/Fetish+and+the+Art+of+the+Teese&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RalKAQAACAAJ&dq=Burlesque/Fetish+and+the+Art+of+the+Teese&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Burlesque_and_the_Art_of_the_Teese_Fetis.html?hl=&id=RalKAQAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RalKAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"On one side, Dita Von Teese shares the beauty of the burlesque world, with bubblegum dreams and show tunes to strip to."}}
