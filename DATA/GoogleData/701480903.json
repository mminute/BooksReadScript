Indeed, from the start, history and identity in America have been intricately tied to issues of space: from the idea of the »city upon a hill« to the transnational (soft) power of the United States, space has always served as an important parameter of power gained or lost and of the struggles to maintain or resist it. With contributions that range from the construction of America in (European) academic discourses to children's fiction, this collection provides an extensive and insightful study of how space influences our understanding of America.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783839420805"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3839420806"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":214,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.11.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA89&dq=DMZ+Vol+7:+War+Powers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":31.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":17.27,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-26vJBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":31990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":17270000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Placing_America-sample-pdf.acsm?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Richards, Dave (2005): »The War at Home: Wood and Burchielli Talk DMZ«, <br>\nComic Book Resources [online], 9 November, ...
