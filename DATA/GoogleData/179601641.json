Gaiman created an unforgettable tale of the forces that exist beyond life and death by weaving ancient mythology, folklore and fairy tales with his own distinct narrative vision. Reminiscent of the legendary Canterbury Tales, THE SANDMAN: WORLDS' END is a wonderful potpourri of engrossing tales and masterly storytelling. Improbably caught in a June blizzard, two wayward compatriots stumble upon a mysterious inn and learn that they are in the middle of a \"reality storm.\" Now surrounded by a menagerie of people and creatures from different times and realities, the two stranded travelers are entertained by mesmerizing myths of infamous sea creatures, dreaming cities, ancient kings, astonishing funeral rituals and moralistic hangmen. This new edition of WORLD-S END collects THE SANDMAN #51-56.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781401236427"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1401236421"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Comics & Graphic Novels"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":7,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.6.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":true,"containsImageBubbles":true,"epubBubbleVersion":"f0e7cc92ff0d579c","imageBubbleVersion":"f0e7cc92ff0d579c"},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Sandman+Vol+8:+Worlds%27+End&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ","seriesInfo":{"kind":"books#volume_series_info","shortSeriesBookTitle":"Worlds' End","bookDisplayNumber":"8","volumeSeries":[{"seriesId":"74fXFwAAABA5kM","seriesBookType":"COLLECTED_EDITION","orderNumber":8,"issue":[{"issueDisplayNumber":"51"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"52"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"53"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"54"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"55"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"56"}]}]}},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":19.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-IfHjAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":19990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Sandman_Vol_8_Worlds_End-sample-epub.acsm?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Sandman_Vol_8_Worlds_End-sample-pdf.acsm?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IfHjAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This new edition of WORLD-S END collects THE SANDMAN #51-56."}}
