Having beaten back the Adversary's first advance into their world, the residents of Fabletown must now prepare themselves for the full-scale war that is sure to follow. For one particular Fable, this means skipping town to launch a new career as a venal Hollywood mogul-a path he hopes will be paves with gold and immortality. For another Fable, though, it means a journey down a much more dangerous road-one that winds through the Fables- old Homelands into the very heart of enemy territory, where the mystery of the Adversary-s identity will finally be revealed. Collects issues #34-41 in Bill Willingham-s Eisner Award-winning Vertigo series.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781401236076"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1401236073"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Comics & Graphic Novels"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.4.5.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":true,"containsImageBubbles":true,"epubBubbleVersion":"44ef3cbaa90e9a1d","imageBubbleVersion":"44ef3cbaa90e9a1d"},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fables:+Homelands&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ","seriesInfo":{"kind":"books#volume_series_info","shortSeriesBookTitle":"Homelands","bookDisplayNumber":"6","volumeSeries":[{"seriesId":"JflXGQAAABBz4M","seriesBookType":"COLLECTED_EDITION","orderNumber":6,"issue":[{"issueOrderNumber":34,"issueDisplayNumber":"34"},{"issueOrderNumber":35,"issueDisplayNumber":"35"},{"issueOrderNumber":36,"issueDisplayNumber":"36"},{"issueOrderNumber":37,"issueDisplayNumber":"37"},{"issueOrderNumber":38,"issueDisplayNumber":"38"},{"issueOrderNumber":39,"issueDisplayNumber":"39"},{"issueOrderNumber":40,"issueDisplayNumber":"40"},{"issueOrderNumber":41,"issueDisplayNumber":"41"}]},{"seriesId":"4BQqGwAAABDLDM","seriesBookType":"COLLECTED_EDITION","orderNumber":6,"issue":[{"issueDisplayNumber":"34"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"35"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"36"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"37"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"38"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"39"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"40"},{"issueDisplayNumber":"41"}]}]}},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":17.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PTTfAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":17990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Fables_Vol_6_Homelands-sample-epub.acsm?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Fables_Vol_6_Homelands-sample-pdf.acsm?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PTTfAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Collects issues #34-41 in Bill Willingham-s Eisner Award-winning Vertigo series."}}
