Salinger's Franny and Zooey collects two works of fiction about the Glass family originally published in The New Yorker. \"Everything everybody does is so--I don't know--not wrong, or even mean, or even stupid necessarily. But just so tiny and meaningless and--sad-making. And the worst part is, if you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you're conforming just as much only in a different way.\" A novel in two halves, Franny and Zooey brilliantly captures the emotional strains and traumas of entering adulthood. It is a gleaming example of the wit, precision, and poignancy that have made J. D. Salinger one of America's most beloved writers.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780316459990"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0316459992"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":208,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":106,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.7.6.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=51-jDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=51-jDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=51-jDwAAQBAJ&dq=Franny+and+Zoey&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=51-jDwAAQBAJ&dq=Franny+and+Zoey&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Franny_and_Zooey.html?hl=&id=51-jDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=51-jDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"&quot;Perhaps the best book by the foremost stylist of his generation&quot; (New York Times), J.
