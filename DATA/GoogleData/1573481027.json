The difference between the well-ordered Union air fields and this dusty garrison is made painfully clear when she runs afoul a brutal commander of ground troops. While trapped behind enemy lines during a bloody uprising she meets Djari, a human civilian whose trust in the governing Union is shattered by what he has witnessed. Indeed, not everything out here seems to run according to protocol and Nova soon suspects that more than farming is being done aboard the Skyranch. When she uncovers the treacherous and illicit schemes taking place, it seems that local riots are the least of their troubles. This is the first of the Targon Tales series, which can be read in any order.
