Only one in ten chases actually intercept a tornado-unless you're Reed Timmer. The thrill-seeking meteorologist and star of Storm Chasers has followed and faced down more violent tornadoes than anyone. Into the Storm brings readers into the mind of this man and his mission—collecting data on tornadoes and hurricanes that could save lives—in the terrifying, awe-inspiring world of big weather. Into the Storm is also a fascinating look at the science of weather—what causes extreme conditions, its connection to climate change, and how a tornado gets its stovepipe structure.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781101444375"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1101444371"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":288,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Nature"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":5,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.1.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Into+the+Storm&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=azTL_6nXzBsC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&rdid=book-azTL_6nXzBsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Into_the_Storm-sample-epub.acsm?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=azTL_6nXzBsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Into the Storm is also a fascinating look at the science of weather—what causes extreme conditions, its connection to climate change, and how a tornado gets its stovepipe structure."}}
