Computers have changed since 1981, when The Soul of a New Machine first examined the culture of the computer revolution. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations. The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780316204552"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0316204552"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":293,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":24,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.2.2.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Soul+of+a+New+Machine&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JP0odQpUKUYC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&rdid=book-JP0odQpUKUYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Soul_of_A_New_Machine-sample-epub.acsm?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JP0odQpUKUYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Tracy Kidder&#39;s &quot;riveting&quot; (Washington Post) story of one company&#39;s efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and has become essential reading for understanding the history of the ..."}}
