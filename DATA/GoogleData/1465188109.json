Elaine Tyler May demonstrated that the Atomic Age and the Cold War shaped American life not just in national politics, but at every level of society, from the boardroom to the bedroom. Her notion of \"domestic containment\" is now the standard interpretation of the era, and Homeward Bound has become a classic. This new edition includes an updated introduction and a new epilogue examining the legacy of Cold War obsessions with personal and family security in the present day.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780465094998"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0465094996"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2rS-DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2rS-DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2rS-DQAAQBAJ&dq=Homeward+Bound:+American+Families+in+the+Cold+War+Era&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2rS-DQAAQBAJ&dq=Homeward+Bound:+American+Families+in+the+Cold+War+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Homeward_Bound.html?hl=&id=2rS-DQAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2rS-DQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This new edition includes an updated introduction and a new epilogue examining the legacy of Cold War obsessions with personal and family security in the present day."}}
