Naomi Klein's second book, The Shock Doctrine, was hailed as a \"master narrative of our time,\" and has over a million copies in print worldwide. In the last decade, No Logo has become an international phenomenon and a cultural manifesto for the critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. As America faces a second economic depression, Klein's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever. Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic exposé, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. Naomi Klein tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1429956496"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781429956499"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":512,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":34,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.6.7.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=No+Logo&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&rdid=book-Yq_WAUXqRAEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/No_Logo-sample-epub.acsm?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic exposé, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective."}}
