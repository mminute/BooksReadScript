In a world where his three true, bitter pleasures are women, booze, and racetrack betting, he somehow drags his hangover out of bed every dawn to lug waterlogged mailbags up mud-soaked mountains, outsmart vicious guard dogs, and pray to survive the day-to-day trials of sadistic bosses and certifiable coworkers. This classic 1971 novel—the one that catapulted its author to national fame—is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780061844041"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0061844047"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":208,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":39,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.6.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Post+Office&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&rdid=book-XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Post_Office-sample-epub.acsm?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XjQ5zlnQ8ZcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This classic 1971 novel—the one that catapulted its author to national fame—is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski."}}
