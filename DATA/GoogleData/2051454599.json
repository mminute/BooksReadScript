Do not buy this reading Sidekick if you are looking for a full copy of this great book.Use this expert sidekick to dissect these themes in Looking for Alaska, while enjoying a detailed analysis of each chapter of the book. If that wasn't enough, we close with potential questions and responses to help you get the conversation started with co-workers, friends, or fellow book club members.This newly discovered gem from the past (2005) has become a must-read, thanks in no small part to the success of Green's 2012 masterpiece: The Fault in Our Stars. As many Green fans have already discovered, our sidekick is the ultimate go-to source for understanding the complexities of John Green's tales of teen angst and tragedy. Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles Halter, a 16-year-old with a nondescript life who is seeking a \"Great Perhaps.\" In his quest, he finds himself at the Culver Creek Boarding School, where his past life of boredom and safety takes a back seat to adventure and sexual experimentation.His trek to the other side of the tracks takes him only a few steps, as he meets Alaska Young just down the hall at school. She is sexy, funny, and everything else that makes teenage boys drool. She is also a self-destructive sort, headed toward the \"After\" portion of Looking for Alaska, where everything comes crashing down. As our sidekick details, the themes of life and death weave their way through the novel, drawing the characters closer together while preparing them for something that will rip them apart.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1497393035"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781497393035"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":58,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&dq=Looking+for+Alaska&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&dq=Looking+for+Alaska&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Looking_for_Alaska.html?hl=&id=5mKkoAEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"WARNING: This is not the actual book Looking for Alaska by John Green.
