The basis for the smash hit Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Gregory Maguire's breathtaking New York Times bestseller Wicked views the land of Oz, its inhabitants, its Wizard, and the Emerald City, through a darker and greener (not rosier) lens. Brilliantly inventive, Wicked offers us a radical new evaluation of one of the most feared and hated characters in all of literature: the much maligned Wicked Witch of the West who, as Maguire tells us, wasnâ€™t nearly as Wicked as we imagined.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780061792946"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0061792942"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":560,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3,"ratingsCount":521,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"3.18.15.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wicked&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&rdid=book-ycOjhHsqTwQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Wicked-sample-epub.acsm?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ycOjhHsqTwQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is the book that started it all!"}}
