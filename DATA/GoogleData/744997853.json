Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism. Then a lethal black chemical cloud, unleashed by an industrial accident, floats over there lives, an \"airborne toxic event\" that is a more urgent and visible version of the white noise engulfing the Gladneysâ€”the radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, and TV murmurings that constitute the music of American magic and dread.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1440674477"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781440674471"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":66,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.13.13.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=White+Noise&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&rdid=book-rKFyI6Jy0OkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/White_Noise-sample-epub.acsm?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rKFyI6Jy0OkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"A brilliant satire of mass culture and the numbing effects of technology, White Noise tells the story of Jack Gladney, a teacher of Hitler studies at a liberal arts college in Middle America."}}
