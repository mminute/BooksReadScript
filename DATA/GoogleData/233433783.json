Air Force Colonel Brandt Strickland, a member of a Pentagon group studying the Russian plan, is certain that the Americans must be on the moon first and that we have less than two years to get there. At stake is control of the world's energy supply. But he has no spacecraft, no crew, and a President vehemently opposed to his mission. The Moon War follows Strickland through the triumphs and tragedies of his incredible odyssey. The story volleys between America and Russia as the countries scramble to launch. Greed, corruption and deception, even at the very highest levels, cause the plot to twist and turn as the tension mounts. With extraordinary technical accuracy, Davey's story assembles a cast of astronauts, cosmonauts, politicians and engineers drawn from real life who react to the unending trials with uncanny realism. Reflecting Davey's experiences as an Air Force officer, an engineer, and an educator, The Moon War tells a tale that may well fill the pages of tomorrow's newspapers.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1480187216"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781480187214"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":376,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&dq=Moon+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&dq=Moon+War&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Moon_War.html?hl=&id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Moon War follows Strickland through the triumphs and tragedies of his incredible odyssey.
