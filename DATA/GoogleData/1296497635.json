She has a subtle and ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly, beautifully, bitterly...This is the only novel of ideas written by an American woman that I can recall.”—The New York Times","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781101137185"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1101137185"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":752,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":141,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.12.13.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qcDM4-3R168C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qcDM4-3R168C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qcDM4-3R168C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Fountainhead&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qcDM4-3R168C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qcDM4-3R168C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qcDM4-3R168C&rdid=book-qcDM4-3R168C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Fountainhead-sample-epub.acsm?id=qcDM4-3R168C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qcDM4-3R168C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"She has a subtle and ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly, beautifully, bitterly...This is the only novel of ideas written by an American woman that I can recall.”—The New York Times"}}
