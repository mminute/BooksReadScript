Le Guin, George R. R. Martin, and J. R. R. Tolkein, but never felt that Rothfuss was imitating anyone' THE TIMES 'I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. My name is Kvothe. You may have heard of me' So begins the tale of Kvothe - currently known as Kote, the unassuming innkeepter - from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, through his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend-hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780575087057"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0575087056"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":672,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3400,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.19.16.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&dq=The+Name+of+the+Wind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&dq=The+Name+of+the+Wind&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Name_of_the_Wind.html?hl=&id=BcG2dVRXKukC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"&#39;This is a magnificent book&#39; Anne McCaffrey &#39;I was reminded of Ursula K.
